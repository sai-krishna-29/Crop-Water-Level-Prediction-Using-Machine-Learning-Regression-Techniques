# Crop-Water-Level-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Regression-Techniques
1. Developed a machine learning model to predict crop water level using a dataset of 10,000 data points.
2. Performed comprehensive data pre-processing: handled missing values: 123, outliers removed: 58, and categorical data (label encoding of 3 columns).
3. Explored feature relationships through a correlation matrix.
4. Compared various regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Lasso Regression, AdaBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM) for prediction accuracy.
5. Achieved a high R2 score of 98.8% with the Decision Tree model, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting crop water levels.
